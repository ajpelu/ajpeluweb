I’m biologist and Master in Applied Statistics from University of Granada (Spain). I’m a PhD candidate at University of Granada. The focus of my disertation is the spatio-temporal dynamics of Pyrenean oak forests (*Quercus pyrenaica*) in Mediterranean mountains.

I work as ecologist at Laboratory of Ecology of Andalusian Institute for Earth System Research since 2009, involved in the Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory and in the Sierra Nevada LTER-site. Previously, I worked as ecologist consultant for four years, focusing on restoration projects and ecology of threatened species.

I like to introduce myself as ecoinformatic. My expertise is on analysis of ecological data with R and programming tools. High experience in use of R, GIS and reproducible science tools (metadata). I’m currently co-leading the Ecoinformatic Working Group of the Spanish Terrestrial Ecology Association (AEET).
