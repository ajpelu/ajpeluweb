Along the gradient, interacting species (*e.g.*, predators, parasitoids) can respond to changes in different ways. This study aims to investigate how egg parasitism of a forest pest, the pine processionary moth (PPM), *Thaumetopoea pityocampa*, vary along an elevational gradient (190–2000 m.a.s.l.) in a mountain range of SE Spain, including areas of recent elevational expansion, for a seven years period (2008–2014). We used generalized linear mixed models to ascertain the effect of both elevation and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (a proxy of interannual climatic conditions) on the rate of parasitism, and the occurrence probabilities of two parasitoid species: a PPM specialist and a generalist species. Since four pine species are stratified along the elevational gradient, we repeated all the analyses separately for lowlands (190–1300 m.a.s.l.) and uplands (1350–2000 m.a.s.l.). Results showed a decrease in both parasitism rate and probability of occurrence of the two main parasitoid species with elevation, although decline was more severe for the specialist species. The effect of elevation was more conspicuous and intense in uplands than in lowlands. Positive NAO winter values, associated with cold and dry winters, reduced the rate of parasitism and the probability of occurrence of the two main parasitoid species—but particularly for the generalist species—as elevation increases. In a context of climate warming, it is crucial to mitigate PPM elevational and latitudinal expansion. Increasing tree diversity at the PPM expansion areas may favor the establishment of parasitoids, which could contribute to synchronizing host– parasitoid interactions and minimize the risk of PPM outbreaks.","tags":["Pine processionary moth","Parasitoides","NAO","Forest pest","Biological control"],"title":"Expansion of elevational range in a forest pest: Can parasitoids track their hosts?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio J.

Here, we focus on rear-edge populations of *Quercus pyrenaica* in Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula) to analyze their ecological and floristic diversity. We perform multivariate analyses using high-resolution environmental information and forest inventories to determine how environmental variables differ among oak populations, and to identify population groups based on environmental and floristic composition. We find that water availability is a key variable in explaining the distribution of *Q. pyrenaica* and the floristic diversity of their accompanying communities within its rear edge. Three cluster of oak populations were identified based on environmental variables. We found differences among these clusters regarding plant diversity, but not for forest attributes. A remarkable match between the populations clustering derived from analysis of environmental variables and the ordination of the populations according to species composition was found. The diversity of ecological behaviors for *Q. pyrenaica* populations in this rear edge are consistent with the high genetic diversity shown by populations of this oak in the Sierra Nevada. The identification of differences between oak populations within the rear-edge with respect to environmental variables can aid with planning the forest management and restoration actions, particularly considering the importance of some environmental factors in key ecological aspects.","tags":["Quercus pyrenaica","Ecological Diversity","Conservation Biology","Floristic Diversity","Oak woodlands","Sierra Nevada","Field inventories"],"title":"Ecological diversity within rear-edge: a Case Study from Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica Willd.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio J.

Resilience to drought of relict Mediterranean *Quercus pyrenaica* populations in the southern Iberian Peninsula was analyzed in relation to historical records of land use, combining dendroecological growth of adult trees and greenness (EVI) as proxies for secondary and primary growth. The growth trends reflected a strong influence of old land-use legacies (firewood removal) in the current forest structure. Trees were highly sensitive to moisture availability, but both primary growth and secondary growth expressed high resilience to drought events over the short and the long term. Resilience and the tree growth response to climate followed a water-stress gradient. A positive growth trend since the late 1970s was particularly evident in mesic (colder and wetter) high-elevation stands, but absent in the most xeric (warmer and drier) stands. The high values of resilience observed suggest that the studied *Q. pyrenaica* populations are located in a geographical but not a climatic or ecological rear edge. Resilience of oak stands to drought events was not spatially homogeneous across the mountain range, due to differences in ecological conditions and/or past management legacies. This is particularly relevant for rear-edge populations where topographic and biophysical variability can facilitate the existence of refugia.","tags":["Quercus pyrenaica","Dendrocronology","Vegetation Indices","Resilience","Sierra Nevada","Drought","Remote sensing","Oak woodlands"],"title":"Land-use legacies and climate change as a double challenge to oak forest resilience: mismatches of geographical and ecological rear edges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Transects were laid out to record different variables such as the number of individuals sighted, the perpendicular distance of each group of Iberian ibex to the transect line and sex as well as age of individuals in the case of males. These data enabled the calculation of population parameters such as density, sex ratio, birth rate, and age structure.
